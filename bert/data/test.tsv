1	The Rlng-tum Phl, October 19, 1989  Abortion: The Final Solution?
2	Thus, I now propose that we look to science to solve the question of abortion.
3	So trust me, I’ll not talk of a new utopia, just abortion.
4	Now the answer to abortion is easy.
5	Should a woman have an abortion?
6	I must admit that this idea of using science to solve the question of abortion is not entirely original.
7	First,  no longer does the question of abortion plague us.
8	Abortion clinics across America have been fascinated, if not frustrated, by its deceptive tactics for rs.
9	In the United States alone, legal abortions have claimed more lives than Adolf Hitler, Joseph  Stalin, the rest of World War It, all of World War I, and the war before that one, and so on, and so on, etc.
10	Pro-choice: protecting women’s rights  MY VIEW  By Elizabeth Parkins and Pamela Patton  “I think contraception is disgusting — people using each other for pleasure.” — Joseph Schneider, Director, Pro-Life Action League  I. Cameron Humphries’ extremely murky “My View,” with its limited comprehension of medical fact (classifying the fetus as an organ, and falsely clairriing that it struggles against abortion), its suspension of reality(mankind conquering death and achieving immortality) and its highly sophomoric tone, have no  place in an intelligent discussion of the abortion issue.
11	Furthermore, by comparing a woman’s right to abortion to Hitler’s “Final Solution,”Humphries is confusing a woman’s freedom to voluntarily choose an abortion with a totalitarian state’s forced genocide.
12	We must assume so, since he does assert that the fetus struggles for life against an abortion.
13	The New York Times answered the film\'s charges way back in March of 1985 by featuring five medical experts who discounted the theory that a l2—week—old fetus(91 percent of all abortions are performed within the first trimester) has sufficient nervous system development for any degree of consciousness, much less the ability to sense danger and react to It.
14	We strongly support Mr. Humphries’ right to his anti-abortion stand.
15	We urge him to help pregnant women who chose not to terminate their pregnancies by supporting pre-natal care for those who cannot afford it, adoption agencies,  foster care systetns, day care services and other vital sociali programs  But if his zeal would lead him to block the doors of medical clinics or endorses legislation barring abortions, his opinions would come into conﬂict with our rights.
16	"But, if abortion is made illegal, and women are forced into unsafe, “back-alley” clinics, or are forced by the state to bear unwanted children, we will find that, to once more quote Humphries, “millions of souls are crying for justice, if we don’t answer them, who will?"""
17	Many voters believe that this election hinged on each candidate’s abortion stance.
18	“The five votes that counted the most in this election were cast not in Virginia but on the Supreme Court,” said state Sen. Robert Scott, D-Norfolk, referring to the Supreme Court’s recent decision allowing states more freedom to restrict abortion.
19	Coleman supported the largely Republican pro—life view, while Wilder expressed his support for a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion.
20	On the subject of tax increases in a Coleman administration, Bush said, “Marshall Coleman is one candidate who doesn\'t confuse having a vision for the  future with having a sharp eye on your wallets.”  more than 5,000  Bush, however, did not speak on the subject of abortion, which had been a major campaign issue and one which several political analysts have said was the  turning point in the campaign for Wilder.
21	Thomas Morris, a political scientist at the Universi ty of Richmond said, “If abortion wasn’t the number      defeated the Wasps last weekend.
22	}.\'I7he turkey. .  States should  MY VIEW By Richard Hill  In the Oct. 26 issue of the Phi, Elizabeth Parkins and Pamela Patton respond to J. Cameron Humphries “My View” against abortion.
23	They claim that Carneron’s “limited comprehension of medical fact,” his “suspension of reality,” and his “sophomoric tone...have no place in an intelligent discussion on the abortion issue.” Well, these ladies’ essay is best described in the terms that Rep. Henry Hyde, a Republican from Ohio, used to describe the 1988 Democratic Platform: “a large bowl of cold soggy mush.”  The two ladies seem to believe that Roe v. Wade is fully intact, and that the Freedom of Choice (or Reproductive Choice, as NOW calls it) is a fully recognized Constitutional concept.
24	"Certainly Elizabeth and Pamela would agree that it is wrong to kill a one day old baby (who, incidentally, carmot survive without help from the mother), and they would most certainly agree that laws should make it illegal to do so; yet, they totally disregard the rights of the fetus and consider “a woman\'s freedom to voluntarily choose an abortion"" as the ultimate right and the ultimate consideration."
25	So killing a fetus is the  sugkf/I L M/‘Iii b1LL°$  say no to abortion?
26	As abortion is murder, Carneron’s comparison of the lives of fetuses to the victim of wars is appropriate, but minuscule.
27	It is murder in every sense of the word, and because murder is a crime at the state level abortion should be as well.
28	It is reasonable to make abortion against the law in all cases.
29	In a recent debate on abortion, one of the debaters said that for someone to say that they are against abortion is to say that they know  more about the issue than the nine  9  4 I  top justices in this country at the time of the Roe v. Wade decisi .  . Well, sorry to say it, but Roe v.  Y  Wade is almost dead, and to rely at it any more as a justification is no longer credible.
30	To imply that all people whp are anti-abortion or pro-life agree with Joseph Schneider is the saint  as saying that all republicans agree  with Lowell Weicker.
31	"To further imply that all people who are against abortion are also against birth-control is outrageous, consider‘ing that I am in ""favor of most forms of birth control and think it is rather silly to be both anti-abortioii and anti-birth control."
32	The states wilf soon have to make the ultimate decision on abortion, and I hope that they all decide to outlaw all aborsy tions, for the sake of humanity and for the sake of the “children” of’ the future.
33	Guest speakers at the rally restressed what they consider the importance of the abortion issue in state-elections as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services.
34	"The Rlng-tum Phl, November 16, 1989  Legal abortion: its safe and...  MY VIEW By Pamela H. Simpson  This is in response to Richard Hill\'s “My View"" article in the Nov. 9 issue (“States Should Say No To Abortion”)."
35	Since Richard has stated so clearly the anti-abortion argument, I feel the necessity to more fully state the pro—choice position.
36	He is right in contending that the Supreme Court has recently reversed the trend of 16 years of legal decisions and seems bent on giving states greater authority to restrict access to abortion.  .
37	While I disagree with his analysis of Roe v. Wade  (it was not a “mishap of legal history,” it was  an assertion of the constitutional right to privacy), 0  it is nevertheless clear that in the future the debate over abortion will be taken‘ up at the state level.
38	The basic difference between the anti-abortion and the pro-choice positions is summarized in Richard\'s logical syllogism: (1) A fetus is a human being.
39	(3) The states outlaw murder; therefore, the states should outlaw all abortions.
40	Richard may believe that, but there  Let’s consider who is being murdered if abortion becomes unattainable.
41	By contrast, the rate now with safe, legal abortion is only three per 1,000.
42	Legal abortion saves lives.
43	The problem is that if you make no differentiation between the born and the unborn, if you insist on anthropomorphizing a dividing cell into a human being, then you fall into the kind of simplistic thinking that the antiabortionists continue to demonstrate.
44	I heard one local politician assert recently that if a woman was raped and the next day took a morning—after pill that resulted in the abortion of  a fertilized egg, then she was guilty of murder.
45	His second premise is that killing a human being is murder, leading him to equate abortion with murder.
46	Let’s consider who is being murdered if abortion becomes unattainable.
47	Before 1973, illegal abortion was the leading killer.of pregnant women in the United States.
48	By contrast, the rate now with safe, legal abortion is only three per 100,000.
49	Legal abortion saves lives.
50	The anti—abortion position would value the potential life of \' a developing zygote over the already established life of a fully developed human being.
51	One argument pro-choice advocates make is that barming abortion legally would not stop abortions at all.
52	It would simply take us back to the pre—l973 position where poor women and vulnerable teenagers risked their lives to obtain abortions, and affluent women ﬂew to foreign countries to get them.
53	Today, safe legal abortions are still relatively available to everyone.
54	The risk of dying in pregnancy is 13 times greater than that of dying in an abortion.
55	Further, matemal mortality has dropped dramatically since the legalization of abortion —in other words, abortions do save lives, women\'s lives.
56	Finally, there is the conclusion Richard makes that since the state outlaws murder, it should outlaw all abortions.
57	Most anti-abortionists do at least allow medical  0 Please see SIMPSON page 3  ...it made Doug Wilder governor  @112 ﬁling-tttm lﬂlti  THE STUDENT VOICE OF WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY  MY VIEW By Brian Root  For the last several weeks, the issue of legalized abortion has been discussed to the point of exhaustion in The Ring-tum Phi.
58	Despite this treatment, the newest aspect of the debate on abortion has been overlooked.
59	While that may sound perfectly ordinary, the content of that ad has revolutionized how abortion is discussed.
60	He said Coleman, who was on record for opposing abortion in virtually all cases, would allow the government to interfere with the people\'s right to choose.
61	By changing the scope of the abortion debate, Wilder shed the traditional view that all Democrats are pro-big government and against individual and state autonomy.
62	Almost overnight, the abortion issue went from politically untouchable to an absolutely essential item  that could only be avoided at the candidate\'s peril.
63	If the GOP is to win the battle of public opinion on abortion, the party must moderate its heretofore extreme position, much as the Democrats must moderate many of their positions if they are to reclaim the White House.
64	Recently, two Republican governors, Thomas Kean of New Jersey and James Thompson of Illinois, said  the GOP must either moderate its stance on abortion or simply leave the decision about the issue to the individual candidates.
65	With the Supreme Court\'s recent Webster decision giving some control over abortion back to the states, the issue will soon become one of, if not the, biggest issues in state and local politics for the next decade.
66	"Most opinion polls agree that the public’s ideas on abortion lie sorne— where between the Pat Robertsons  and the Jesse Jacksons of the world. """
67	If their strict overall view of abortion is not somehow modiﬁed and moderated, they risk losing touch with much of their constituency, particularly women.
68	But Richard is right: if a fetus is a human being and abortion is murder, then there should be no exceptions, right?
69	There is no area of American law that requires one human being to sacriﬁce life, limb, blood, or bodily organs for another person, but that is what a total ban on abortion would do.
70	I find most disturbing, however, the callous disregard for wornen’s lives that is inherent in the position that Richard and the anti-abortionists maintain.
71	"Few of us are “for"" abortion."
72	‘ _ Hitz said he doesn’t like to see his name -in the paper every week, and said “Terance’s resignation has unfortunately brought it all again.” He added, “I don’t see that I  exude any bad faith, and I don’t,  know why people see me that way.”  I     RALLY  from page 1  abortion-rights the premiere issue in  any campaign in which the candi dates’ opinions differ.

74	Pro-life: abortion more than just a woman’s choice  MY VIEW  By Damon Fensterman  Indeed, the debate does go on.
75	Second, Prof. Simpson’s position on the  ‘dangers of illegal abortion is highly suspect.
76	‘She uses emotive language to paint a picture of poor, innocent mothers being “murdered”  By Merrill Watson  if there is no legal abortion.
77	Moreover, the figures which Prof. Simpson uses grossly exaggerate the dangers of illegal abortion.
78	I found figures from the National Center for Health Statistics showing the number of deaths resulting from illegal abortions was five per 1,000 abortions (compared to Prof. Simpson’s 100 per 1,000).
79	Finally, Prof. Simpson’s position is based on the false assumption that legal abortion removes the dangers of illegal abortions.
80	The fact is, illegal abortions have continued despite legalization.
81	In addition, Prof. Simpson would have you believe that every person who would get an abortion today would have an illegal abortion if they had to.
82	In fact, following the legalization of  abortion, one less illegal abortion meant 18 more legal abortions.
83	First, would a prohibition (especially one with legitimate exceptions) really cause an overwhelming number of illegal abortions?
84	Second, is it worth 18 more abortions to eliminate one illegal one?
85	She accuses pro-lifers of holding the position that if abortion is murder then there should be no exceptions.
86	But a prohibition with exceptions is a far cry from carte blanche abortion.
87	If we did that, we would all opt for abortion on demand.
88	The risk that abortion murders a human being is simply too great.

158	The abortion debate will always be decisive and inﬂammatory.
159	Let me begin with her “pet peeve.” Miss Clarke objected  u topeing addressed as a “pro-abort.” We pro-lifers  don’t call our opponents pro-abortion to be vindictive or annoying.
160	However, even  abortion advocates will admit that there are limits to those choices, particularly when they may violate the choices and rights of others.
161	The abortion debate is not about “choice.” If it were really about choice, Miss  .
162	According to the Centers for Disease Control (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), 98% of all abortions are done for birth control reasons.
163	And according to the Alan Gutmacher Institute (the research branch of Planned Parenthood), half of all abortions are performed on wtﬁnen who chose to use abortion as their only means  I of birth control.
164	From the pro-life perspective, the debate is about the human life they believe is destroyed during every abortion.
165	So it is unfair to say that pro-lifers believe that “the law has full jurisdiction over a woman’s uterus,” as Miss  among many, abortion counselor J oss Sawyer writes that “adoption is a violent act” compared to the “simply remedy of early, safe abortion.”  In reality, contrary to Miss Clarke’s accusations, it is really the pro-lifers who are giving women the genuine choices.
166	Miss Clarke and I will probably never come to an agreement on the issue of abortion, but it is important to understand each other’s position.
167	Even if the abortion proponents completely disagree with pro-lifers, they must understand that because we believe 1.6 million children die every year as a result of this lamentable “choice,” their battle to “preserve Roe v. Wade” will never end.
168	If I didn’t believe that a human life was destroyed during every abortion, I would be right next to Ms. Clarke at those NARAL demonstrations defending a woman’s right to choose.
169	Third, the term implies the pro-abortion movement promotes genuine choice regarding crisis pregnancies.
170	If the pro-abortion side is only concerned with providing women the option of aborting, then why are they so hostile towards informed consent and adoption?

360	Secondly, once welfare recipients, an overwhelming majority ofwhichare single mothers, actually do gain employment, their entry-level positions will still leave them short of the fonnidable expenses associated with medical and child care.
361	In this case, it would be foolish to abolish welfare altogether, as some very conservative thinkers advocate, because we would actually be punishing recipients for going out and ﬁnding work.
362	A moderate welfare refomi would provide for vocational education programs as well as to subsidize health and child care costs, beneﬁts that are not normally associated with entry-level positions.
363	Abolishing welfare altogether would continue to provoke povertystricken Americans to resort to crime and the black market, while moderate reforms would give lower class Americans a work ethic in which personal responsibility is rewarded.
364	Four years ago, the American people voted to give a Democrat the chance to make signiﬁcant inroads in the ever eroding welfare system; he has failed.
365	It is time to replace Bill Clinton a Republican candidate who speaks for the millions of Americans who want to see a welfare system which ethic and personal responsibility in which children of poverty-stricken families are not punished for the conditions under which they were born and leaves their parent(s) little incentive to work their way out of it.
366	DANCE CLASS  for FD  The Republican Party, believing that welfare should be a transitional rather than a subsistence program, resolves that welfare benefits be terminated after one year.
367	Megan Fernstrum  F0  “The number of  welfare  recipients is  growing daily  with no  end in  sight, and  the majority  of the  children of  welfare  recipients  Welfare is the general term used to label the overall package of government need-based beneﬁt programs.
368	Welfare assistance, given primarily in the form of monetary support, food stamps, and health beneﬁts, was originally designed to be a temporary beneﬁt program.
369	Sadly, the welfare program in the United States has fallen short of this admirable goal.
370	Today’s welfare programs bear no resemblance to their originally intended prototypes.
371	Welfare has become a means of subsistence for millions of Americans, the vast majority of which could and should be productive members of society.
372	Worse yet, the number of welfare recipients, most of whom are able-bodied, is growing daily with no end in sight.
373	This trend is even more frightening when one considers the fact that the majority of children of welfare recipients become recipients themselves as adults.
374	The welfare program in the United States has clearly failed.
375	Rather than helping the less fortunate to reach the American dream, welfare has created a culture of dependency which stands in direct opposition to the free market spirit upon which our country was founded.
376	It is for this reason that the welfare system must undergo refonn.
377	Welfare must become what it was originally intended to be a temporary assistance program designed to help able-bodied Americans become economically self sufﬁcient.
378	To be effective, welfare reform must address the adverse  incentive structure of the current program, the root cause of dependency.
379	Recipients can remain on welfare for years at a time while essentially receivinga minimum wage salary.
380	Even more amazing is the fact that the current welfare program actually provides incentives for illegitimacy and the break down of the nuclear family.
381	In essence, the welfare system encourages women to bring children into the world which they are ﬁnancially unable to care for.
382	The result is a soaring rate of illegitimacy and a generation of welfare children either do not know or have very little contact with their fathers.
383	Welfare reform must eliminate the adverse incentive structure of the current program and replace it with incentives which encourage self-sufﬁciency.
384	A one year cap on benefits will make welfare what it was designed to be-a temporary assistance package which fosters self-sufﬁciency.
385	He continued by outlining basic Republican ideals such as a ﬂat tax, term limits and welfare system reform.
386	I can assure you that you won’t be hearing many ads directed at allowing subsistence hunting but you will hear a lot about education and welfare reform.
387	His feeling was that the economy and welfare and healthcare reform would be major issues.
388	Welfare and healthcare reform are very important and if there was not a presidential election this year than these issues would probably be resolved.
389	The President and the Congress both agreed  on a welfare reform bill that would have been signed I  if the Republicans in the Senate hadn’t added a Medicare rider that was unacceptable to the President and the Democrats.
390	Since the Civil Rights Movement, welfare, crime, illegitimacy, single-mother households-all of these things have increased, and blacks’ position in this country has not improved.
391	Black culture implicitly approves ofviolence, rampant sexuality, illegitimacy, and dependence on welfare.
392	Without life and liberty, social welfare policy is a luxury citizens cannot afford.
393	At a time when Republicans in Congress are slashing important domestic programs such as education, welfare and environmental protection, the US government is spending gross amounts of taxpayer funds to maintain a huge military complex that is, in effect, rotting away in ship-yards and hangers across the nation, never to be used in this age of diplomatic, economic, and multilateral intervention, through organizations like the UN.
394	Other, more liberal states such as New York which has been  traditionally very liberal in welfare distribution will set higher limits.
395	The result will be a mass exodus of welfare recipients to the state that allows them the highest amount of welfare for the longest time.
396	They have placed every thing from welfare to speed limits back in the hands of the states.

440	Bush‘s remarks came on the second day of his Education Summit with Governors, only the third meeting between a sitting president and the states’ chief executives, at the University of Virginia.

443	Speaking at University Hall on the UVa campus late Thursday morning, Bush quoted the six-yearold report of the Committee on Excellence in Education and said its conclusion, that America is “a nation at risk,” is still true today.
444	And Bush insisted greater federal funding will not decrease that risk.
445	“Hard experience teaches that we are simply not getting our money’s worth in education,” said Bush.

448	Ponderings of political poppycock  THE SBAR SIDE By Jon Sbar  As a journalist in a democratic society, it is my duty to keep readers up to date on important political issues such as the latest developments in President Bush’s ongoing war against drugs: yesterday a U.S. army regiment was ambushed by P.C.P.
449	At this point, careful readers with news oriented brains should be asking six obvious questions: 1) Why is President Bush waging a war against inanimate objects?
450	The American public wants to read about President Bush\'s recent ﬁshing trip, not the Middle East.
451	About 300 protestors (right) attended the summit’s  closing ceremonies, along with Bush and UVa President Robert eO’Neill (far right).
452	And educational reform is an urgent responsi bility for every parent, every student, every community,” Bush said.
453	Fourth, Bush said, “We must act on what we discover.
454	But neither will indifference toward good educators.”  Finally, standards and expectations must be high, said Bush, even those applied to the urban poor.
455	“Let no child in America be forgotten or forsaken.” In brief remarks at the summit\'s closing ceremony Thursday afternoon, the president, using UVa’s Rotunda as a backdrop, ran down what he saw as the highlights of “a very successful conference.” Referring to the joint statement issued by the president and the govemors, Bush touched on topics he had mentioned in his morning address and also suggested the federal government will continue and perhaps expand its support of Head Start and other pre-school programs.
456	Bush also promised his commitment to education would not end when he left Charlottesville.
457	"Their chants, barely audible where Bush was speaking, included “Racist, sexist, anti—gay, President Bush, go awayl"" and “Less ﬁlling — Tastes great!” Signs held up by the crowd supported ideas as diverse as privatizing education, the Equal Rights Amendment and victory for the Sandinista government over rebels in Nicarggua."
458	During President George Bush\'s visit to Charlottesville last month, the then—president of the University of Virginia, Robert O\'Neill, pointed out that Thomas Jefferson is mentioned at least every two hours on the UVa campus.
459	Bush rallies Coleman forces  By Genienne Mongno Associate Editor  RICHMOND —In a last—minute  Virginia’s gubenatorial election in favor of the Republicans, President George Bush appeared at a rally for Republican candidate J . Marshall Coleman last Friday.
460	Bush gave his full endorsement to Coleman as well as to Sen. Eddy Dalton, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, and Sen. Joseph Benedetti, the Republican candidate for attorney general.
461	In his speech to an audience of  who attended the rally, Bush called Coleman “a man of integrity and experience, a man who deeply loves  this state.’ ’  “Marshall knows the issues that matter most to  Virginians,’ ’ said Bush.
462	And he knows it’s time to confiscate the dealers’ ill-gotten gains an take the profit out of the drug business,” said Bush.
463	"Bush also adressed the issue of education saying as convinced as I am that there is no other issue more vital to the future of this state, this nation and to the kind of lives our children will lead."""
464	Hopefully Bush will give this up, too.

468	Finally, by sending over 20,000 troops to Panama, Bush ensured that the situation would be resolved and the troops would return quickly.
469	Bush should be congratulated on a job well done, and the soldiers who fought there should be honored as heroes.
470	Barnes said that President George Bush’s policies are symptoms, rather than causes, of this new era.
471	The mission, according to President Bush, “was to safeguard the lives of Americans in Panama, combat drug trafficking, and protect the integrity of the Panama Canal Treaty.”  When it came time to jump, Missert said he was scared, but there was so much to do, and his ruck was  Fancy _Dress is just around the corner, so »why not impress your _ date with the foxtrot or a perfect waltz.

526	Sophomore MacGregor Tisdale defended President George Bush’s past record in foreign policy, noting what he called successes, like the liberation of Kuwait, the removal of drug lord Manuel Noriega from power in Panama, the removal of the Berlin Wall, and the move of eastern bloc countries toward new.
527	But the Democrats held that, despite Bush’s accomplishments, the president’s views have shifted to match public opinion.

532	It is not surprising that this populist rhetoric is doing well in a nation afflicted with recession, especially when the incumbent Republican president is running on the continuation of present policies, Bush, a moderate, seems to be regaining much of the conservative support he lost in the early days of Buchanan’s campaign.

547	The Fling-tum Phi, September 17, 1992  WASHINGTON —— The search for reasons to re-elect George Bush resembles for many the 19th century search for the source of the Blue Nile: hard going.
548	Can you convincingly promise similarly constructive chaos and acrimony — a less kind and gentle Bush, beginning now, by vetoing the $2.3 billion legislative appropriation bill, the money Congress spends on itself?
549	The Ring-tum Phi Post Office Box 899 Lexington, Virginia  24450  WASHINGTON— The 1992 presidential carnpaign has crossed the 20-yard line into what some NFL footballers have started calling the “red zone.” The fightbetween George Bush, 68, and Bill Clinton, 46, is now deadly serious.
550	Four years ago, Bush learned that the best way to sack an opposing quarterback is, a) have the team captain himself nail the  target first; b) have the rest of  Tuesday and Nov. 3, expect to see sweaty faces, bone-wrenching tackles and lots of mud on the uniforms.
551	Within a split second after Bush connected at his Wisconsin rally, well-placed ringers had  Here\'s how the Bush side, down by 15 points, now seems intent on pulling it out:  1.
552	The Bush—Quayle forces have obviously decided that they can\'t win the game on points.
553	Why else did the Bush side spend the past week red-dogging challenger Bill Clinton on how he dealt with the draft nearly a quarter-century ago?
554	What\'s striking, especially to the experts watching, is that George Bush led the draft assault himself.
555	Bush-Quayle coach Jim Baker knows that, with time running out, the home team has two great advantages: a)It can decide when to stop the political game and act presidential, tending to Hurricane Andrew, Saddam Hussein and other nasty advantages of incurnbency; b) It can also decide when to play to game.
556	Hence coach Baker\'s stall: Ifhe agrees to a debate schedule now, with the President still 10 or mot: points down, he sends Bush onto the field as a decided underdog.
557	If he plays the clock another week, keeping maximum pressure on Clinton\'s “character,” he’s got an outside chance of having Bush meet his rival with the point difference down to five.
558	q  For some very potent reasons, expect the BushClinton confrontations done by no later than midOctober.
559	The Bush team wants to have the messy game of politics out of the way to give the White House folks plenty of time— three weeks would be exceb lent, to display for voters the uncertainties facing American in the world today, the absolute need for a president with the global seasoning, and yes, the character, to face down these uncertainties.
560	Having devoted September to shaking voters’ faith in Bill Clinton, late October will be devoted to instilling a renewed faith in George Bush, convincing Americ that its best hopes for the next four years lie with the team that\'s been running things the last four.
561	Instead of referring to George Clinton and Bill Bush by name, use “Fat Sleazy Imbecile” and “Gaunt Whining Bastard.” Your readers will appreciate the clariﬁcation.
562	Williamson believes Braun wasted her post-prirriary glow, much as Bush wasted his after Desert Storm.
563	Williamson feels dragged down by Bush who, he says, is perceived as intolerant on moral issues and injurious to the economy.

573	Indeed, they threatened to add insult to injury, dating the President\'s representatives to let the debate talks founder over the Bush-Quayle desire to bring “Cliff Notes” onto the stage with them.
574	The effort of the President\'s handlers to arm their man with “notes” for his prime-time debates with Clinton and independent Ross Perot is, itself, a nasty confession of Bush’s re-election predicament.
575	To take on 46-year-old Bill Clinton, a man he mocks as insufficiently prepared, George Bush wants a script.
576	‘  But the most damning request of the Bush-Qiiayle forces was their call for “notes.”  On Oct. 5, Vice President Quayle absolved Bush-backer Arnold Schwarzenegger from his criticism that movies have too much sex and violence.

590	He ranted about the debt, “the gorrilla charging up the front steps,” and promised task forces that would look at the “plans lying all over Washington.” At one point he let Miles/Clinton‘ and Schneider/Bush tear into each other for a few minutes before getting up and remarking on two-party gridlock.

592	With the election fast approaching, and with PresidentBushattacking hard at Clinton’s sincerity, this is the key question of the 1992 election:  Is Bill Clinton the man he says he is or merely an Arkansas-accented member of the Walter Mondale-Ted Kennedy-Jesse Jackson faction?
593	@1992 Tribune Media Services, Inc.  D  WASHINGTON—Everest has been conquered and the Amazon has been explored, so the biggest challenge remaining for intrepid people is to state reasons for re-electing George Bush.

595	Regarding these subjects, Bush’s administration is at its best and a Clinton adrriinistration might be at its worst.
596	The leaders of Bush’s Education Departrnent— , Secretary Lamar Alexander, David Keams, Diane Ravitch — and Lynne Cheney at the National Endowment for the Humanities are valuable precisely because their intense interest in ideas makes them so unlike the president they serve.
597	There are 200 other reasons to re-elect Bush.
598	That is the number of federal judges Bush would nominate, at his current rate, in a second term — approximately one every seven days.
599	The negligible presence of the Bush presidency in American life is perhaps the best reason for preferring Bush to Clinton.
600	‘  Bush is presiding —— without reﬂection, of course —— over a welcome miniaturization of the presidency.
601	Another Bush term and that office may be back where it belongs, back where the sainted Coolidge kept it, on the periphery of national consciousness,drained of priestly pretensions about being custodian of “values.” Restoration of constitutional balanQe and a sense of political proportion would be served by four more years of this incredible shrinking presi denc .
602	Americans, who  GEORGE WILL  Washington Post Writers Group  waste $14 billion worth of time and fuel because of congested highways and airports, need in that re—electing Bush would prove there is no penalty for failure in American politics.
603	Bush’s record is poor and his carn paigri has been execrable.
604	Before the 1988 campaign a Democrat said, “If we can’t beat Bush, we have to pick another country.” If after these four years and this campaign the Democratic Party loses again, it may become as irresponsible as the Republican Party became after 1948 (remember Joe McCarthy), when it lost a fourth consecutive election.
605	Liberals who excoriate Bush for his “irresponsible” no-new-taxes pledge shouldnote that Clinton pledges no new taxes on individuals other than those with adjusted gross earnings of at least $150,000 and on joint ﬁlers camin g at least $200,000.
606	But runner-up Republican George Bush, played by Andrew Schneider, stole the show in terms of laughter with his squeaky, shaky  voice and exaggerated gestures to ,  imitate the president.
607	“Maybe the Soviet bear is gone,” Schneider/Bush said, “but there are many wolves out there.

621	Regarding Bush, what the New Republic says merrily, conservatives must gloomily acknowledge: “Bush has done to conservatism what no liberal opponent could have done: he has destroyed it from within.” He has treated it as a mere expedient for his attainment of office.
622	There cannot be such a conservative movement until the Republican Party is out from under Bush’s control.
623	Bush has received more than Clinton from seven categories.
624	But Clinton has decisively beaten Bush with the heaviest contributing category: lawyers and lobby .The nation needs what no contemporary Democrat can be, someone controlled by this core conviction: The point of an enterprise society — in a sense, the American premise — is that prodigies of productivity can result from millions ofuriheroic actions by individuals going.

628	Liddy said the election this year was a “clear choice.” A vote for Clinton would constitute a vote for more govemrnent and higher taxes, while a vote for Bush would constitute a vote for less government and lower taxes.

630	The seeds of Bush’s political destruction were , planted that very day.
631	Bush shifted power to people like Nicholas Brady, his new treasury secretary; Richard Darman, his new budget director; people with neither feel nor fondness for Americans who, unfamiliar with the grand ﬁscal matters of state, are nonetheless all too familiar with less celestial realities, like telling a teen-ager there’s not enough money for that college he’s been dreaming about.

875	—— Junior Cottie Miles as Bill Clinton, on cultural ignorance, employing the second definition of “inbred”  WASHINGTON —— With triumph on sight, Bill Clinton has suddenly veered right.
876	“A different Democrat” is what    Clinton’s campaign veers to the right  grand strategy, or simply week—to-week tactics?
877	4  I have two reasons to hope that Clintonmeansprecisely what he’snow confessing in cities like Cheyenne and Pueblo —that he intends to build a centrist Democratic administration, attuned to economic growth rather than redistribution, to individual responsibility rather than public largesse, to justice for criminals rather than “furloughs.”  The first is Clinton’s long support for the maverick Democratic Leadership Council.
878	As a chairman of the DLC, Bill  Clinton has led the charge against this Old Democratic Order .
879	The fact that he’s returned to his centrist roots so close to Nov. 3 is the best evidence that Clinton is seeking not just a middle-class victory butga pro-middle class mandate as well.
880	But regarding the judicial branch, where an ethic of process should prevail, Clinton seems purely result-oriented.
881	America\'s notorious litigiousness (more than 18,400,000 civil suits were ﬁled in  stead on the argument that Clinton would be even  GEoRGE WILL  state courts in  ,cerning education and the — 1 . politicizing of culture.
882	A Clinton presidency probably would bring to education policy the sclerosis of the public education lobbies, and to the NEH the batty political culture of a college English department chock full of deconstructionists.
883	Republican nominees are less apt to regard the judicial branch as a second legislative branch, and Clinton and Congress might do what Carter and Congress did when they expanded the federal judiciary by 30 percent.
884	When Clinton singled out Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackrnun (the least intellectually formidable of today\'s nine) as a sitting justice he would have liked to have appointed, he may have been merely in  woge.
885	Alas, Clinton is the candidate of the trial lawyers.
886	\'  Regarding the economy, Clinton’s sometimes naive and sometimes tendentious bandying of wealth distribution indicates both bad economics and halfbaked moral theories.
887	With his unreﬂective rhetoric  CIinton’s election would end  about “the rich” paying “their fair share,” and ids ‘ promise of increased equality through income redistribution, Clinton shows that he does not know the crucial questions about modern society, let alone useful answers.
888	Or at least undefended, because liberals like Clinton are so cocksure of their moral intuitions that they feel no need to explain exactly why society would be bettcr off if income distribution were made more equal by government action.
889	A Clinton presidency would be hyperkinetic.
890	Advertising does not reﬂect the opinion of The \'  WASHINGTON— Pursuant to the sound advice that one should perform an unpleasant duty each day to stay in moral trim, today I concoct the best case I can for electing Bill Clinton.
891	One reason for electing Clinton is  government it already is getting, and certainly does not need most of the additional government that Clinton promises and that the Democratic Congress will merrily augment.
892	Clinton’s life has unfortunatelybeen an almost seamless glide from campus into government, but at least he has been a governor and may be amenable to fresh thinking about federalism.
893	It is possible, if just barely, to hope Clinton can undertake this, against the opposition of all the interests to which he and his party are beholden — interests with much invested in their leverage in Washington.
894	Clinton and his party think they have cornered the market on “compassion” and can ‘—‘control”_ the cost of medical care.

1127	According to the Clinton administration, the national service program will begin with 1,000 students and w\' I increase to 100,000 students by 1997.
1128	Clinton compares the plan with the Peace Corps, although at its height, the Peace Corps involved only 16,000 young people.
1129	For good reason, Clinton stated that the program should not become bureaucratic.
1130	In his campaign manifesto, Clinton proposed to “scrap the existing student loan program and establish a National Service Trust Fund to guarantee every American who wants a college education the means to obtain one.” Following that promise, the Clinton administration has suggested these grants could replace Pell Grants, which are awarded to needy students.

1344	For example, President Bill Clinton recently outlined his two criteria for good public policy: “Number one, it should be good for America; and number two, it should be good for the economy.” This statement reveals the  President’s collectivist bent.

1392	And sadly, the Clinton administration has only bolstered such impressions by.--refusing to do anything more than repeatedly wam the Chinese government.
1393	Where President Reagan won peace through strength, Bill Clinton has won more conﬂict through appeasement by refusing to apply the economic sanctions that China’s military and commercial actions merit under U.S. law.
1394	However, many in Congress are now coming to the realization that the Clinton administration’s actions have seriously weakened the United States’ position internationally and that the U.S. must stop mere posturing and stand up for principle and national interest.
1395	Upcoming debate over the renewal of China’s MFN trade status and Clinton administration decisions regardingthepossibleapplicationoftrade sanctions will make it clear whether Bill Clinton is willing to act as a strong advocate for U.S. interests or whether he is capable only of token reactions to the most extreme provocations.
1396	of A PMLTY THEME       Washington’s Blood Sport  Ends & Means Joshua Heslinga ’98  As the 1996 election approaches and the public begins to reﬂect on the Clinton presidency, no doubt some of the most enduring memories will be of scandal.
1397	The Clintons and White House personnel have repeatedly attempted to put such scandals as Whitewater, the death of Vince Foster, the firing of the White House travel staff, ’I‘roopergate, and the Paula Jones sexual harassment case behind them.
1398	Stewart began this book at the Clintons behest, and they quickly promised full cooperation.
1399	Revealingly, after an initial meeting that Stewart had with Hillary Clinton, this cooperation never materialized, although Stewart interviewed many key ﬁgures in the thick of the scandals for the ﬁrst time.
1400	As Stewart’s background might tell you, this book is a complete and detailed look at the scandals revolving around the Clinton administration.
1401	Those looking for a hatchet job on the Clintons andthose looking for an apologia on their behalf are both likely to be disappointed.
1402	By contrast, if you’re intrigued by the atmosphere surrounding these scandals, if you want to know what the fuss is all about, or if you’d like to get a little insight into key ﬁgures of the Clinton administration and the workings of the media, this book is for you.
1403	This has allowed the Clintons to attempt to dismiss Stewart’s work as old news, but they are wrong in doing so.
1404	This book revolves around people, creating a very readable, if intricate, story It gives a rare glimpse at a clannishArkansas political culture, a relentlessly digging me dia, and a Washington atmosphere where, as Vince Foster wrote, “ruining people is considered a sport.” And it exposes the attitudes of key ﬁgures on all sides, with  1plications that the Clintons should haﬁly be proud of.
1405	But the unethical nature of many of the dealings involved and of the Clinton’s private lives is clear.
1406	While Bill and Hillary Clinton campaigned against the ‘80s as the “Decade of  Greed,” they and their associates engaged ’  in the same pursuits.
1407	As the Clintons repeatedly professed innocence and wondered why the media didn’t just accept presidential proclamations without question, they and their associates blocked information inquiries, changed their stories repeatedly and in some cases, blatantly lied.
1408	But neither does it attempt to disguise the Clinton’s careless, immoral, and unethical behavior that they, particularly Hillary, imperially believe should be disregarded.
1409	Are we prepared to answer these tough questions, or have we all, like the Clintons, become “deeply enmeshed in a Washington culture so inured to partisan distortion and  spin that truth is the most frightening pros pect of all?”  Betsy’s performance anxiety  fortable underwear:  Green Land Betsy Green ’97  with us.
1410	Political pundits have continuously pointed to how similar the situations in the book are to the Clinton campaign.
1411	Although it is a work of ﬁction, many will recognize questions of draft-dodging and extramarital affairs as the same questions that dogged Clinton before he became the “Comeback Kid.”  No doubt that Clintonlovers and Clinton-haters alikewillrelishtryingto recognize what characters represent George Stephanopoulos, James Carville, Bill Clinton, and Hillary Clinton.

1413	And in view of President Clinton’s recent commitment to increase U.S. aid for Israeli missile defense systems, one has to wonderwhy the President thinks missile defense is good enough for Israel but not for the American public.
1414	President Clinton’s repeated commitments to these unbudgeted operations in places of questionable national interest like Bosnia and Haiti cost U.S. taxpayers more than $4 billion in 1995, money that comes from other needed defense programs.
1415	President Clinton vetoed the bill, claiming that the procedure is only used in cases where the baby’ poses a severe threat to the health  of the mother.
1416	Clinton’s veto also provoked an unprecedented letter of con demnation from all 8 cardinals of the American Catholic church, who labeled the practice infanticide, and even the President’s ambassador to the Vatican sided with the Catholic Church’s position.

1420	Bill Clinton used the occasion to chide Bob Dole for not wanting to give American workers more money, despite the fact that in the February 6, 1995 issue of Time magazine, Clinton argued that an increase in the minimum wage, “is the wrong way to raise the income of low-wage earners.”  While many Republicans agreed that this made good policy (or maybe political?)

1451	Starting in Gate 1 is Clinton, with jockey Al Gore.
1452	The candidates round turn one, Clinton jumps out to the early lead and Dole is caught up in the pack.
1453	“Heading into the back stretch, Dole is pulling away from the pack, and Clinton\'s lead is shrinking.
1454	“Clinton pulls slowly away heading into the final turn.
1455	We are in the home stretch, Clinton leads by about a half mile over Bob .Dole.
1456	Clinton slows down and trots across the finish line.
1457	“From the Right” focuses on Bill Clinton ’s inability to make decisions in the international arena.
1458	Jason Zacher Editorial Editor  From the Left Laura Knapp ’99  With less than a week to go until the election, I think that it is pretty safe to say that Bill Clinton will not be needing any change of address forms.
1459	So let’s turn our attention to two Congressional races in which the Democratic candidates are not ensured victory like Bill Clinton but are indeed highly worthy of it.
1460	Like President Clinton, they are the best choice for the future of America -students, seniors and citizens alike.
1461	Today, we have Bill Clinton.
1462	Bill Clinton‘s foreign policy is afflicted with a typical male disease, he refuses to stop and ask for directions when lost.
1463	From Bosnia, to Haiti, to China, the Clinton Administration has shown a tremendous lack of direction.
1464	Bill Clinton’s only major foreign achievement, the Mid-East Peace process, is much the same way.
1465	Former Secretary of State James Baker Ill, got the process on its way toward the “achievements” that Clinton has taken credit for.
1466	When North Korea struggled for a nuclear weapon, and finally looked as if they were going to achieve it, Bill Clinton said that there is no way the North Korea would be allowed to become a nuclear state.
1467	But when  push came to shove, Clinton backed  down, instead telling North Korea they could basically keep what they had as long as they do not produce any more, and threw in a nuclear reactor to boot.
1468	Upon his election in 1992, Clinton told the American people that China would not have their Most Favored Nation trading status renewed if they could not control the intellectual pirating and improve their human rights record.
1469	In a masterful bit of eleventh hour negotiating, Clinton backed down, deciding that Most Favored Nation status should not be linked to these issues.
1470	Clinton will also tell you that he helped contain Saddam Hussein.
1471	Many analysts feel that Hussein wanted an administration with little  direction, and wanted to bolster Clinton’s approval rating.
1472	Clinton did make the right decision to bomb Iraq again, but maybe he should  “Bill Clinton’s  foreign policy is  afflicted with a typical male disease, he refuses to stop and ask for directions when lost.”  decide on a meaning for “proportional response.” , \' Thereare many other foreign policy bungles that the Clinton administration has participated in, lest we forget the Japanese trade crisis, Haiti and Bosnia.
1473	Before he sent troops, Clinton should have seen that peace cannot be kept in the region without a major power sitting on them (Tito’s Yugoslavia worked pretty well).
1474	I did not think that our troops would actually come home by Christmas, but Clinton should have never made that promise.
1475	Since it seems like a foregone conclusion that Clinton will be back in the White House until the year 2000, we can only hope he switches his Secretary of State.
1476	PAGE 6  OPINION / ADVERTISING  Forcing both parties to the center  From the Right \' Jason Zacher ’98  The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor  Recently, G. Gordon Liddy said, “Clinton’s ‘bridge to the 21st century’ is a toll bridge, and we’re all going to have to pay.”  Everyonebreakouttheirchange.
1477	Election “96 is over, and, not to anyone’s surprise, Bill Clinton has been reelected.
1478	Clinton received 49.2% of the vote, compared to 40.8% for Dole, 8.5% for Perot, and 1% for Ralph Nader.
1479	Another surprise was that a majority of women voted for  Clinton and a majority of men voted for Dole.
1480	A  Bill Clinton’s next term will be interesting to watch.
1481	The “egomaniacal” President Clinton, as Senior Mark Tobias so eloquently stated, has done everything in the hopes of getting re-elected.
1482	»  Others are rumored to be on Clinton’s chopping block, and Republicans may fill a few of the spots.
1483	Clinton wants to prep him for Gore’s “A new tree in every yard and an electric car in every driveway” campaign in the year 2000.
1484	Do you have an ego the size of Bill Clinton’s?
1485	Clinton’s victory is a victory for America  From the Left Laura Knapp ’99  It has been well over a week since President Bill Clinton scored an amazing, decisive, but totally anticipated victory over Bob Dole.
1486	In all honesty though, I am breathing a sigh of relief for the United States, for world civilization, as well as for humanity itself rather than brimming with arrogance over Clinton’s victory.
1487	The United States is virtually ensured of entering the twenty-first century on stable footing, of course not taking in account a double assassination of both Clinton and Gore where in which the Speaker of the House would become President (a fact that was recently  brought to my attention which I consider just crazy on the part of the Founding Fathers.
1488	I myself would take the bullet and endanger my life for Clinton or Gore in order to prevent such an occurrence.)
1489	There are just a plethora of reasons why Americans—Dem0crats and Republicans alike—should be relieved that Bill Clinton won.
1490	What I believe to be the most comforting about a Clinton presidency is that he actually cares about what the American people really want.
1491	The triumph of Clinton in this election symbolizes the fact that a president can be independent of such forces that have at times dominated the presidential arena.
1492	The fact that Bill Clinton has made an effort to include Republicans on his cabinet indicates both a sense of maturity on his part as well as a realization that Americans are not either Democrat or Republican.
1493	Clinton embodies tolerance, moderation and what is right forthe nation.
1494	Bill Clinton had promised that our troops would be home for Christmas, but now that promise, like so many others, has faded into memory.
1495	The Clinton administration tells us that of our 14,000 troops currently in Bosnia, 8,000 troops are going to stay until March.
1496	Richard Holbrooke, the US diplomat that negotiated the peace agreement, is urging Clinton to keep troops in Bosnia, so the civil war will not start again.
1497	Bill Clinton had the right idea by sending troops to Bosnia, but the time is going to come when it will not make any difference who is there.
1498	Registrar’s Office considers modernization     FOPINION  From The Left proposes Clinton focus on the race  ., relation problem in his second term.
1499	PAGE 2  OPINION  JANUARY 20, 1997  Clinton should focus on race relations problem  During the Inauguration today, William Jefferson Clinton will again officially assume the duties and obligations of the office of the Presidency.
1500	It is from this point on, as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. states, that Bill Clinton “faces his rendezvous with history.” Unable to run for office  From the Left Laura Knapp ’99  again, Clinton must “make his mark between now and January 19, 2001.” With his first term riddled with inconsistencies and lack of strong leadership, Clinton now has four years to turn the tide.
1501	Schlesinger believes that “Clinton’s second term offers at once the potential of greatness and the potential of humiliation.” In an article entitled, “The Ultimate Approval Rating,” Schlesinger updates his father’s earlier ranking of Presidents,.
1502	But at the same time, one particular response galvanized my opinion that Clinton’s ultimate goal should and must be to solve the problem of race relations.
1503	We are all at a critical juncture; what we need is strong leadership and President Clinton to set clear goals in order to stem the growing discontent felt by both sides of this issue.
1504	Essentially, Bill Clinton just needs to do the right thing.
1505	“From the Right” looks at Clinton\'s effortless policy switches.
1506	PAGE 2  OPINION  JANUARY 27, 1997  Clinton heads for distinguished place in history  When President Clinton took the oath of office last Monday, he became the first Democratic president since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected twice to the presidency.
1507	Clinton’s second term does not face the dire circumstances that Roosevelt faced, communism is dead, and the economy is running well, so  From the Right Jason Zacher ’98  The Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor  what is Clinton to do this term?
1508	The things on Clinton’s agenda, to date, have been very vague, but he will probably outline some of them during his State of the Union address.
1509	What we should probably ask is what is on Hillary’s agenda, since without her, Clinton would be a hapless president, without any direction whatsoever.
1510	David Brock said that Clinton has placed whatever principles he has in a receivership maintained by  his wife.
1511	Even his most ardent defender, James Carville, has asked other advisors where Clinton stands on issues.
1512	In a CNN/Time poll taken after the November election, of the 49 percent of voters that cast their ballots for Clinton, only 14 percent agreewithhispositions.
1513	Unfortunately,Clinton sees his election as a mandate to enact his policies, not much unlike the Republicans in 1994.
1514	Clinton will get more than his chance by being the first president to have line-item veto powers.
1515	Since he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton’s policies have seemed to steadily move right.
1516	Some of Clinton’s promises in this recent campaign came at the behest of Democratic party leadership.
1517	His gradual adoption of the progressivism cham “Clinton is setting himself up to set his place in history.
1518	This is not to say that Clinton’s second term is goingto be plagued by a major scandal,  but after seeing his first term, I do not think it would surprise anybody.
1519	Clinton tries to assert that he is not ideological, which Historian Gary Wills says, “infuriates|iberals while not convincing con,servatives.” Clinton is setting himself up to set his place in history.
1520	Clinton needs to understand that policies will be passed, and people will get hurt.
1521	—-COMPILED BY Tom WADLow  P OPINION  Betsy Green redefines “The Rules.” From the Left tt attacks Clinton\'s second inaugural address.
1522	“Hypothetically, the SCC could accuse      PAGE 2  OPINION      FEBRUARY 3, 1997  Clinton’s address falls short of expectations  “You are questioning Bubba?,” a disbelief-stricken Republican friend recently asked me when I offered my critical appraisal of Clinton’s Inaugural Address.
1523	But I certainly have the right to do so; while I am a liberal and a Democrat, the  From the Left Laura Knapp ’99  combination of the two does not automatically or necessarily make me a complete and utter “Clintonophile.” I do believe that Clinton was the best choice this pastNovember (especially when considering the other candidates) but that distinction does not put him above reproach.
1524	I concede that Clinton definitely has a long road ahead if he even dreams to secure a positive legacy for himself.
1525	However, Clinton’s problems  are indeed the same as those of modern leadership — a success in recognizing the problem but a failure to propose a way to go about solving it.
1526	In his firstinaugural address, Franklin Roosevelt promised “A new deal for the American people,” and inadvertently set a precedent that would be evident even in Clinton’s address.
1527	The same can be said for Clinton’s address.
1528	However, given the track record from his first administration,Clinton will never achievethe same degree ofsuccess as FDR.
1529	Clinton needed to clear and forceful, qualities that will be essential for the next four years while waging a fight for change against unrelenting Republican congressmen.
1530	Instead, his  speech is replete with breezy, insubstantial verbiage, invoking only half-hearted patriotism and profound puzzlement  “The Amrican people elected Clinton to lead, not to fall back  into the ranks  with the general citizenry.
1531	Clinton uses lofty phrases like “Guided by the ancientvision ofa prom ised land, let us set our sight upon a land of new promise,” and conjures UtopianSequa visions like, ‘‘In this new land, education will be ever citizen’s most prized possession.
1532	Our schools will have the highest standards the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and boy. . .Our streets echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore.”  While all that he does say sounds wonderful and desirable, Clinton does not offer any specific measures of HOW to go about achieving such dreams.
1533	Clinton states that “Government is not the problem and government is not the solution.
1534	,  The American people elected Clinton to lead, not to fall, back into ranks with the general citizenry.
1535	Clinton’s “Bridge to the 21st Century” looks something like the overpass in “Speed” —dangerously incomplete and desperate for a miracle.

1539	On Thursday, Mr. Clinton backed  From the Right  Jason Zacher ’98 Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor  this proposal in his budget, increasing education spending by 13 percent, but at what cost?
1540	Clinton’s first proposal of national standards for education is overdue.
1541	The incredible inﬂuence the teachers’ unions in this country prevents the poor teachers from being fired— hopefully Clinton will weaken the teachers’ unions through this action and districts can remove these bad teachers.
1542	First, true to Democratic form, Clinton slashed our defense  spending by another 3.4 percent.
1543	Clinton is abandoning his ambitious plans by slashing spending on airports, bridges, roads and railroads.
1544	In what is becoming the story of the Clinton presidency, some areas he gets so right, and others he gets so very wrong.
1545	Unfortunately, PresidentClinton sees ourinternational competitiveness as the price.
1546	But instead of hurting a few Americans, Clinton would rather hurt our country and its international standing as the only super power in the world.
1547	I was rather disappointed that all the networks took the high road and showed President Clinton instead of the verdict.
1548	President Clinton thinks everyone should go to college.
1549	Clinton presents solution for public school problems  There is so much truth in the statement: “A mind is a terrible thing to waste.” Undoubtedly, all Washington and Lee students gave credence to such a belief many years ago; for ifthey had not, they  From the Left Laura Knapp ’99  certainly would not be here.
1550	President Bill Clinton has made education his number one priority for the next four years, “to ensure that all Americans have the best educationinthe world.” Although his proposals have been characterized as “ambitious” by Republican skeptics, President Clinton deserves full support on any and all measures that seek to improve the quality of America’s public schools and make American students more competitive for the 21st century.
1551	In his State of the Union address, President Clinton proposed a number of measures that would make grossly under—funded, under-staffed schools look like the high schools from which many Washington and Lee students graduated.
1552	One of Clinton’s most aspiring proposals is in regard to making a college education available to all American citizens, through the use of tax breaks and increases in stu Quote of the Week  “The co—op just isn’t a cool place to hang out when you’ve got the funk.”  a W&L student dressed in vintage 70 ’s funk             Ivseasyz     at    463-2556      jzaeher@w1u.edu    dent loans.
1553	Clinton’s proposal is aimed at giving these students that incentive.
1554	President Clinton made the astute observation that, “One of the greatest source of our strength in the Cold War was a bipartisan foreign policy.
1555	"Miller ’98  Democratic fundraising improper  President Clinton ’s micro-managing of ﬁmdraising diverted his attention  As rumors of special councils abound, Republicans scream, the Justice Department balks, and Senator Fred Thompson prepares his Congressional investigation, the  From"" the Right Jason Zacher ’98  Ring-tum Phi Editorial Editor  American voter simply wants two things: an end to the scandal and campaign ﬁnance reform."
1556	After the Republican victories in 1 994, President Clinton and the,Democratic National Committee realized that in order to get reelected, a massive fund raising push must be made.
1557	In a return memo, Mr. Clinton proposed that contributers that paid $50,000 to $100,000 could “sleepover” at the White House.
1558	On the back of the memo, Mr. Clinton wrote, “Ready to start overnights right away.” After that point, Mr. Clinton was involved in micro-managing the fund—raising effort until the election.
1559	And in President Clinton’s first term, 938 guests stayed at the White House.
1560	* White House official Evelyn Lieberman wrote a memo to policy advisers that issue briefings would be “considerably truncated or eliminated” so Clinton could adhere to his find raising schedule.
1561	In a dramatic policy turn-around, Mr. Clinton was quoted as saying that assault rifles were, “a tool that Americans can use to fight crime.” This came immediately after a coffee with leaders of the} NRA.
1562	Mr. Clinton has repeatedly denied that the coffees and “overnights” were used to solicit money, and that nothing improper happened.
1563	Johnny Chung, a California businessman, gave $50,000 to the DNC and got invited with six Chinese officials to watch the taping of Mr. Clinton’s radio address in March 1995.
1564	Last week, it surfaced that this check was pre sented to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides inside the White House.
1565	Huang also reportedly took money from  individual contributions and other events, and reported them as money raised at two dinnerswhich Mr. Clinton attended.
1566	Though there is a tremendous grey area surrounding Mr. Clinton and the DNC, it is clear that even though these actions may not be illegal, they are clearly improper.

1573	Should Clinton be impeached, it is possible that Gore would follow.

1590	I1€WS  Clinton pledges work-study cash  BY WILL HARDIE  NEW\'S EDITOR  President Clinton wants to spend an extra $70 million on the federal work-study program, but quite how that might affect Washington and Lee students remains to be seen.
1591	Clinton called it “an opportunity to help us build the promise of America,” but Washington and Lee Director of Financial Aid John DeCourcy said, “The effect will be negligible on the individual students.”  If Congress approves Clinton’s budget proposal, the federal govem— ment will spend an extra $70 million on the Federal College Work Program, which currently helps pay for the college education of more than 940,000 students across the nation.
1592	Clinton’s proposals have the tentative support of both parties in Congress, though the Republicans are cautious about overspending.
1593	Even if Clinton obtained the $70 million he wants, nationally this would be worth only $7.45 per current recipient.
1594	If Clinton’s extra dollars were shared out equally among work-study programs nationally, according to the number of students on each program, W&L would receive a $2500 increase, to $174,500.

1917	Trees spotted, forest missed, says student  On May 4 last spring, I wrote a “My View” discussing Michigan State University’s affirmative action policy.
1918	In the formula used, points are added to the scores of minority students, as an affirmative action policy.
1919	My view is quite simple, to the extent that affirmative action singles out a minority, it is discriminatory.
1920	Finally, I must take issue with Ms. MacDonald’s assertion that “racist reactions both follow affirmative action policies and necessitated their introduction.” First, outraged reactions from non-minority students who have been deprived opportunities as a result of affirmative action are not racist.
1921	The reaction is not to the race of the person who took their place as a result of affirmative action, but rather a reaction to a policy which allows someone an unfair advantage over them.
1922	Although I strongly support equal opportunity, and am opposed to discrimination on the basis of race, sex, creed, or color, I can see no need for affirmative action.
1923	As I said in my earlier opinion, affirmative action is just another name for officially sanctioned discrimination.
1924	Minority job opportunities — Granted affirmative action has many problems Mr. Patterson, what organization doesn\'t, but until anyone of any race or gender, with the capability, can compete for a job knowing that the only thing that may bar their way is not having the best qualiﬁcations, there needs to be something to protect people from job discrimination.

1926	I dream of a day when affirmative action and bigotry will be recognized as synonyms, when employers will realize that there never can be an “equal opportunity/affirmative action employer,” when blacks and whites will together understand that race is either relevant or irrelevant.
1927	To this end, affirmative action-type programs were implemented with two principal goals in mind: 1) to place blacks on an equal footing with  their white counterparts; and 2)to make reparation for the past wrongs.

1931	Although Lagarde responded affirmatively, I think the Alumni Weekend edition speaks for itself (nice cover, guys).

1934	I believe that article is slanted against minorities and completely mishandles the thorny issue of affirmative action.
1935	Making contact:  Meredith blasts affimative action     By Gregory Patterson Staff Reporter     The first black man to attend the University of Mississippi told a Lee Chapel audience last Wednesday night that affirmative action must be abolished in order for blacks to succeed.
1936	James Meredith, who enrolled at Mississippi in 1962 and who is the only black person on the staff of Republican North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, spoke on ‘*Education and the Racial Question.’  He told the crowd that affirmative action was a curse to competitive blacks, who were then seen as ‘‘tainted because no matter what the reason...they were in the school or what their qualifications were, they were suspect because of some special program and that is a horrible thing.”’  Meredith went on to say the family has been pushed out of the education process as a result of the ‘‘takeover of the educational machinery by the union movements...I just don’t think a union can run a school.”’  ‘The only way that a large number of black males between the ages of 10 and 16 can be taught is with the disciplinary assistance of middle-aged black women.
1937	Affirmative Action, military appointments, deconstructionism and a host of other items are debatable and amendable, yet nothing can be accomplished until the frustrated authors of these misbegotten articles deal with the fundamental principles behind each of these issues.
1938	Articles on Affirmative Action end up being lirades on unqualified Blacks.
1939	Without going into what ‘‘unqualified’’ means, the history behind Affirmative Action, why it was implemented, what it has done and is supposed to do is left unchallenged.

3031	This Fall, forthe first time in 40 years, Republicans look poised to do magniﬁcently at the polls.
3032	But even more exciting is the possibility, conﬁdently held out by none other than Newt Gingrich, that Republicans might win control of the House of Representatives; such a blessed turn of events, if we recall, has not occurred since the administration of Harry Truman.
3033	Two things work to limit the giddy enthusiasm of Republicans at this stage, however.
3034	I know that many Republicans sincerely believe that America’s salvation lies in the election, say, of Oliver North to the Senate, or perhaps in control of the Senate itself, but I entertain no such delusions.
3035	It is old-hat to say that Democrats believe (usually, at least, even if they never admit it) that ‘government is the answer to the problems of individuals’ — but what do Republicans believe?
3036	I propose the following: Republicans believe, or at least they should, that individuals are the answer to the problems of government and society —— the exact converse of the Democrats’ belief, logically enough.
3037	Republicans have always believed in the potential of indi viduals, and have thus been willing to give those individuals the freedom to pursue their own designs.

3125	The Republican Party over the last thirty years has transformed itself into the party of ideas.
3126	In an attempt to emulate the Republican Party’s passion for ideas, the Mock Convention would like to encourage the entire student body to actively participate in debating not only whom the Party should nominate, but also the platfonn it should adopt.Although Mr. Christensen makes a notable contribution to the great debate that is part of the Mock Convention, his ideas conceming Kemp and moderate Republicans are on the fringe of the party.
3127	Moderate Republican presidential candidates are dinosaurs in the current political environment.
3128	Without the groundwork laid by Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan, the Republican would not have control of both houses of Congress for the ﬁrst time in 40 years.
3129	Kemp was one of the Republicans to see the Party as the majority party.
3130	While Kemp has been instrumental in helping the Republican Party achieve its recent successes, he is not without his faults.
3131	Frum correctly points out , in a recent Wall StreetJournal editorial, the lack of support for a Kemp presidential run came from a “new determination among Republicans to cut the federal government down to size.”  Kemp will not be the nominee because he has not shown the willingness to cut government to the degree demanded by the mainstream Republican party.
3132	He has been a key player in developing the modern Republican Party and will remain an important ﬁgure in American politics.

3157	Instead of giving up on the Republican candidate, Tafel arranged a meeting with candidate Weld to discuss items of concern to Massachusetts’s gay community.
3158	Similar efforts have been made to alert and educate Republicans about gay and lesbian rights issues by the Log Cabin Republicans, Tafel’s group, notably with such gay-friendly Republican politicians as New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman.
3159	Now Tafel is a critical link in lobbying the 103rd Congress, the first Republican Congress in 40 years.
3160	Traditional lobby groups such as the Human Rights Campaign Fund and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force have found themselves limited in their access to Republican politicians because of a perceived  « Do You Want VISA 8.

3162	Tafel describes the Log Cabin Republicans as performing a “mediating role” between the gay community and the Republican lawmakers now in power.
3163	Democrats take their support for granted, while Republicans do not appeal to the gay community because they feel it is a vote that cannot be won.
3164	In 1994, studies showed 1 in 3 gay or lesbian voters voted Republican.

3166	Tafel said the key is for gay and lesbian Republicans to take a stand in their own party, one he says was founded on the basis of less government interference in people ’s lives.
3167	Tafel pointed out that the only reason the religious right has had so much inﬂuence on the Republican party is because they just plain showed up at local meetings and made their presence known in Republican primaries.
3168	Kemp  APRIL 28, 1995  calls  for reform at Kick-off  By DAN ODENWALD Phi Executive Editor  Jack Kemp officially opened the season of Republican presidential politics at Washington and Lee by demanding reform at the 1996 Mock Convention’s Spring Kickoff Tuesday morning.
3169	Kemp believes the Republican victories in the congressional elections of 1994 ushered in a revolutionary period of time ideal for carrying out changes in America.
3170	Kemp announced his support for another Republican reform — the flat tax.
3171	In the true spirit of any Republican National Convention, Kemp used his speed to bash the Democrats for irresponsible government and promoting class warfare.

3195	He knows the politics of exclusion will ruin the chances for a Republican victory in ’96.” Specter responded, ‘‘I welcome the support of all Americans who oppose discrimination and who seek a more limited government, joining the principles of ﬁscal conservatism with social libertarianism.” Specter’s presidential campaign has speciﬁcally targeted the Christian Coalition and its leaders for harsh criticism.

3205	While Republicans in Congress view the cuts as integral to their budget plans, GOP governors insist that the cuts must be reasonable in order for the states to withstand them.

3218	College Republicans  BY CELESTE RAsMussEN Phi Staff Writer  EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part one of a three-part series examining different political organizations on  campus.
3219	One such organization is the Washington and Lee chapter of the College Republicans.
3220	With around 105 members, College Republicans is one of the largest political organizations on campus.
3221	Under new leadership, their first meeting was held last month and featured appearances by many local Republican campaigns including Commonwealth’s Attorney candidate Bob Armstrong and his campaign manager J.H.
3222	Also present were professors Connelly and Rush and a representative from the local Rockbridge County Republican Association.
3223	Chairman Edyth Poecker cites many new goals for the College Republicans this ear.
3224	Secondly, she would like to see the group have an active participation in the upcoming Republican campaigns; and , ﬁnally, she would like to bring new speakers and programs to the College republican meetings.
3225	The Tusk, the newsletter of the College Republicans, states that the group is interested in reassociating itself with the College Republican Federation of Virginia and sponsoring trips to Washington, D.C. and Richmond, VA to see historical sites and attend political conferences.
3226	Other officers of the College Republicans include 1st Vice Chairman Joshua Heslinga, Secretary Demian McGarry, and Treasurer Christina Petrides.
3227	Earlier this year, ‘ Republicans came under fire for pointing out the idiocy codified under the ADA, including  save Medicare from bankruptcy, and they have abandoned the U.S. to exploding debt by defeating the Balanced Budget Amendment and resisting crucial budget cuts.
3228	The entire message of the Democratic Party for the past several months has been to declare that Republicans on the Hill plan to starve the poor and condemn elderly grandmothers to death by lack of health care in order to pay for unwanted, undeserved tax cuts for the rich.
3229	In doing so, they have abandoned the elderly by refusing to help Republicans pass the necessary reforms to  ing the poor?

3231	Candidates make history with  early ads in New Hampshire  MANCHESTER, NEW I-IAMPSHIRE—-It is four months until the ﬁrst Presidential primary takes place in New Hampshire, but the Republican candidates’ advertising in the state is already in full swing.
3232	Buchanan’s tough tariff talk rattles Republican Party  FORT DODGE, lOWA——Pat Buchanan, on a recent campaign tour through Iowa, advocated a strict policy of economic nationalism which sent shock waves through the ﬁeld of Republican candidates.
3233	The overall effect, many analysts believe, of Buchanan’s tough talk is to drag the Republican party platform further to the right as the other candidates attempt to embrace Buchanan’s ideas in order to attract voters.
3234	They also hope to sponsor a seminar along with W&L’s other two political party organizations, The College Republicans and the College Democrats.
3235	That is one reason that the Republican provision in the “Contract with America” that expands private property rights is so popular.
3236	And of course Republicans echo this view as well in their ballyhooing over the issue of “family values.”  But why does America seem to be faltering?

3240	Never mind the fact that the Republican measure offers seniors true choice and ﬂexibility and the potential for signiﬁcantly expanded beneﬁts in their Medicare coverage for the ﬁrst time ever, while preserving the right of every senior to remain in the current system.
3241	Democrats got up, one after another, to proclaim that Republicans were “slashing” seniors’ health care to pay off their wealthy backers.
3242	Washington Post columnist and budget expert Bob Samuelson, who is opposed to the Republican cuts, remarked in a recent column that “their [Democrats’] endless carping about the ‘tax cut for the rich’ merely disguises their own unwillingness to confront the budget deﬁcits.
3243	Republicans have made some unpopular choices about government; Democrats have not.”  But let’s ignore the political dimension for a moment and focus on some hard evidence about where the Republican tax cuts are going.
3244	Families with incomes below $50,000 receive roughly two-thirds of the Republican tax credits.
3245	Samuelson notes again, “Under the congressional budget resolution, the Republicans can’t enact a tax out until the CBO [Congressional Budget Ofﬁce] certiﬁes that their plan would balance the budget by 2002.”  Only after that time are the beneﬁts to the economy from reduced deﬁcits factored in, and these resulting increases in economic growth and decreases in interest rates produce $170 billion in increased revenue to the federal government.
3246	Likewise, the  ‘Republican pro posal to cut the capital gains tax is hardly the kickback to wealthy donors that Democrats would like to portray to  Democrats are shamelessly exploiting these issues for political gain, while offering only to take more of the American people’s money to finance the failed lib $245 billion Republican tax cut.
3247	As Republicans in Congress continue to fulﬁll their promises, stimulate economic growth, preserve important programs for America’s future, and return control over the American people’s money to the American people, it is clear which party holds the promise of policies to secure a new dawn in America’s future.
3248	People often ask me whether I am a Democrat or a Republican.
3249	This  makes sense, since -I am a dues-paying member of both the College Republicans and the College Democrats.
3250	To put it bluntly, the Democratic Party died when it failed to grasp the meaning of the 1994 Republican Revolution which swept Newt Gingrich and a GOP majority into power in Congress.
3251	This is not to heap too much lavish praise at the feet of the Republicans.
3252	I think I’ve been fairly even-handed about it all, and hopefully entertaining as well, and now, if you’ll excuse me, as an American, as a Republican, as a Californian, I need to publicly dance on the political grave of Pete Wilson.

3331	GOP Watch is compiled by Laura Knapp  A wra     BY CHRISTINE N. GARNAVISH Phi News Editor     The Washington and Lee 1996 Republican Mock Convention was a tremendous success, due in no small part to speakers Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and Bill Bennett.
3332	Former Vice President Dan Quayle warmed up the already roaring crowd by proclaiming the Republican Party is not divided but united.
3333	“Let’s start creating a culture of independence...It is time we put our children first.”  Such staunch Republicanism animated the audience, and the security staff began to eye the crowd suspiciously.
3334	“We are convinced, now more than ever, that we need a Republican president,” said Quayle.
3335	"“Sophisticated folks are watching [the Washington and Lee Mock Convention].”  Dan Quayle Newt Gingrich  -u to the 1996                                                                                                                                                                                The Ring-tum Phi, March §, 1996     Gingrich’s speech revolved around the future of an America with Republican leader"" ship."
3336	Riding the enthusiasm of the crowd, Bennett opened with, “To heck with San Diego, let’s just do [the Republican National Convention] here.”  Bennett said that America is the nation to which other countries turn in times of need, but this should not eclipse the government’s duty to protect the American people first.
3337	Sure we need the national government to protect us from hostile countries, but according to the Republicans, that may be the only thing we need it for.

3355	The crux of the dispute lies in the belief of congressional Republicans that America\'s defense policy must undergo some policy changes in order to prepare for the beginning of the 21st century.
3356	Nonetheless, that philosophical commitment leaves many practical questions of defense policy open to debate, so here are three of the key arenas where Republicans in Congress will clash with the White House.
3357	Democrats have leveled charges of pork and excessive defense spending against Republicans, but such charges fall apart under careful scrutiny.
3358	By comparison, uncontrolled social spending on entitlements like Medicare and Social Security dwarfs this level of funding, and Republicans even drew ﬂak for suggesting that the growth of Medicare should be reduced to a mere 6.5%.
3359	The media is right about one thing; The Republican Party ‘has arrived at a defining moment.
3360	In   . . the Republican I-Party.
3361	”  the 1994 congressional elections, not a single pro-life incumbent, Republicanor Democratic, lost to a pro-choice opponent in the general election — the most under reported story of the election.
3362	Finally, as Republican primaries across the country demonstrate, most recently in the Illinois govemor’s race, pro-life voters represent a clear majority of the Republican Party.
3363	Unlike the Democrats, Republicans have allowed debate on the  issue.
3364	While the Democrats denied 3  pro-life Democratic Governor Bob Casey of Pennsylvania a chance to even speak at their 1992 conven tion, the Republicans’ supposedly M  “hate-filled” convention featured several prominent pro-choice  speakers.
3365	The congressional newspaper The Hill reported last week that the K approximately 40 pro-life congressional Democrats (a number roughly equal to that of pro-choice Republicans) intend to try to pro% voke a debate over the issue at their convention, although they hold little hope of success.
3366	"For the moral future of the nation and the political future of their party, Republicans must have "" the courage to make the difficult choice for life."
3367	Nonetheless, Republicans should look toward another event from last week to find the winning formula for 1996.
3368	Despite their personal differences about whether to adopt a ﬂat tax or a national sales tax, these men gathered to unite behind a system that “applies a single, low rate to all Americans; requires a supermajority of both chambers of Congress to raise taxes;  provides tax relief for workin g Americans, protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax collection abuses; eliminates the bias against savings and investment; and promotes economic growth and job creation.”  These Republican lawmakers realize that the American people will no longer suffer under the current burdensome tax code.
3369	Tax reform must form one of the pillars of any winning Republican vision, as it presents one of the clearest examples of how the Republicans stand for innovation and liberty while the Democrats stand for nothing more than, to use Armey’s words, “raising the status quo.” For the past several elections, Republicans have had success only when they have succeeded in making taxes a key issue in the campaign.
3370	And will the Republicans and Democrats stop tryingto win political points and talk about the problems of this country in some constructive way?
3371	They also demonized Republicans who favored a smallbusiness exemption, designed to reduce the number of jobs lost and businesses closed because of the increase.
3372	These states have seen alliances between their Republican governors and a few Democratic legislators to expand educational opportunity.
3373	Instead of cutting Head Start programs and college loan programs like the Republicans are in Congress now, the US needs an expanded role, rather than restricted, in the future of our nation.
3374	Both Democrats and Republicans have cut military spending, but politics has dictated the cuts.
3375	A cut in military spending could bring a tax—cut that the Republicans have been itching to give.
3376	This is another topic that seems to»  always be in the debate, but-because of recent:  Republican actions in Congress, is ‘especially relevant.
3377	Jason Zacher Editorial Editor  From the Left Laura Knapp ’99  One of the Republican battlecries of the past few election seasons is that the federal govemment is the root of all evil in American society and that if elected, they will slash the authority of the federal government.
3378	But the Republican goal Of taking éontrel awayifrom the federal government is riddled with inaccuracies, innuendo and a total lack of regard for the lessons of history.
3379	I guess the Republicans will feel better knowing that the federal government is more efficient even if it is at the expense of putting families out on the street just because they do not possess the skills nor the funds now   . . the United Statesfederal government is.
3380	And the Republicans call themselves the “family values” party?
3381	The Republicans however, want to decrease the power of the federal government, and in-\' crease the power and scope of the military (if you recall my opponent’s column from last week) while cutting programs like educational funding.
3382	The question that the Republicans have tried to pose is this: “How can some government bureaucrat know what is best for a small business owner in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin?”  The answer is that the bureaucrat has no idea.
3383	That is the true “caring government” that the Republicans are, and the Democrats should be, striving for.

3390	In reality, he stirred things up his whole life, becoming friends with George Wallace, David Duke, and Ronald Reagan, and bucking the black establishment by becoming a Republican.
3391	However, this shift, which has become readily apparent in his first term as President, does not convince the Republicans, and has alienated many Democrats also.

3397	It is time for the Democrats to follow the Republican lead and realize that some very tough decisions are going to have to be made about the entitlement spending in this country.
3398	Maybe, just maybe, with aRepublican congress, this budgetwill  correct itself.
3399	Now I ask you, and I ask all our nation’s governors, I ask parents, teachers and citizens all across America, for a new non—partisan commitment to education, because education is a critical national security issue for our future and politics must stop at the school house.” This certainly should not be a Democrat versus Republican issue.
